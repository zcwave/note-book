/*
 * Implementation notes: hashCode
 * ------------------------------
 * This function takes a string key and uses it to derive a hash code,
 * which is nonnegative integer related to the key by a deterministic
 * function that distributes keys well across the space of integers.
 * The specific algorithm used here is called djb2 after the initials
 * of its inventor, Daniel J. Bernstein, Professor of Mathematics at
 * the University of Illinois at Chicago.
